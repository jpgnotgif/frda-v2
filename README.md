# frda-v2

A mobile application to display SFV character frame data. Note this is updated version of the [frda mobile app](https://github.com/jpgnotgif/frda). I migrated this app to v2 because upgrading React + React Native was causing me too many issues. The approach of migrating the code via a fresh project worked well and seemed more practical given the size of the code base. Also, I'll be moving the implementation away from making outbound http calls for data.

## Why was this built?

1. I want a programatic way to access frame data for the games that I :heart: to play.
2. I want a way to expose myself to unused technolog(y||ies)
3. I want to introduce myself to mobile development

## Bootstrap

  1. Install packages from ```package.json``` via ```npm install
     --save```
  2. Run ```npm start```
  3. Run the simulator or scan the QR code using the [expo.io app](https://expo.io/)

## Note

**This project is still WIP**
